# Pizza-Order

## Purpose:
This is my fourth code review for Epicodus.  The assignment was to create a site where customers can order a Pizza, using object oriented JavaScript.

## Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap

## Known Bugs:
There are no known bugs.

## Specs:
The basic behaviors of this site include the following:
  1. Allows users to select the pizza size, and translates that into a base cost.
    -Example Input: [extra large]
    -Output: [$14]
  2. Allows the user to select toppings, and calculates additional cost at a rate of $2.00 per topping choice.
    -Example Input: [large], [pepperoni, sausage]
    -Output: [$18]
  3. Generates a receipt after the order is made.
    -Example Input: [large], [classic tomato sauce], [pepperoni, sausage]
    -Example Output: A receipt with a line for size, a line for sauce, a line for toppings, and the price [$18] at the bottom.

## Live Site:
The live version of this site is hosted at the following URL: https://tristanmeinke.github.io/Pizza-Order
